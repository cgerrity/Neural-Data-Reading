Files that we read from USE, as of 03 Feb 2022:


The "RuntimeData" folder has files of interest in the following subfolders:

- "SerialSent" has messages sent from USE to the SynchBox, with Unity
  timestamps. These are per-trial plus a startup file.
- "SerialRecv" has messages sent from the SynchBox to USE, with both
  Unity and SynchBox timestamps. These are per-trial plus a startup file.
- "GazeData" has eye-tracker data in TSV format. These are per-trial.
- "FrameData" has USE state information, including eye tracker timestamps,
  in TSV format.

NOTE - Trial files are stored as "_N.txt", "_NN.txt", etc; either use the
third-party "sort_nat" to sort them, or sort data based on timestamps.


The "ProcessedData" folder has ".mat" files with data tables:

- "SerialData.mat" has SerialSentData and SerialRecvData tables.
- "RawGazeData" has the gaze data.


The "use/USE_Analysis" scripts on GitHub are used for converting raw into
processed data.

More recent ones are in "use_analysis" on bitbucket (private repository).
