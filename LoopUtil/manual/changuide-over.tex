The ``NeuroLoop Channel Tool'' is a GUI application that looks at folders
containing neural recordings and identifies channels that have spikes and
channels that have LFP bursts.

The intended use of this tool is for examining high-channel-count recordings
to identify channels that have interesting behavior without a human having
to manually examine each channel. The tool is designed to do this quickly
enough that it may be used during experiments (analyzing a short initial
recording to identify channels of interest in the primary experiment).

Chapter \ref{sect-howto} gives a walk-through of how to use the Channel Tool.
