# NeuroLoop utilities v1 bug list, feature requests, and abbreviated changelog.


## To-do list and bug list for version 1:

* (channel tool) Feature request:
Be able to read epoch markers from event codes and collect statistics only
for portions of the signal within epochs.

* (channel tool) Feature request: Function on epoched segments without being
able to filter the original continuous signal (zero-pad and then filter the
epoch only).

* (channel tool) Add "cancel" buttons to interrupt processing and plotting.

* (channel tool) The in-dialog "pretty and slow" plots for burst power spectra
have colour issues. Stand-alone plots look okay. These are made using
nlPlot_axesPlotPersist(). This may be a palette-fighting issue.

* (channel tool) Add CSV output to callback_dataSaveAll().

* (channel tool) Add spike channel sorting. This has been deferred for now.

* (channel tool) Add "at most N chosen burst channels per bank".

* (channel tool) Burst band selection label needs "Hz" after frequency range.

* (channel tool) Empty plot is white the first time but invisible after
subsequent updates before plotting.

* (channel tool) Auto-refresh when entering the burst channel sorting dialog.
Perhaps do so after adjusting, rather than having to click "refresh". Perhaps
also auto-select the first channel in the list.

* (impedance) Move "simple" clustering into ZMODELS instead of it being a
special case. Pass an arbitrary model structure to readAndBinImpedance().

* (impedance) Fold metadata like "order to test clusters" and "maximum
distance to be in a cluster" into ZMODELS.

* (channel tool) Add support for channel mapping.

* (channel tool) Add support for selecting banks to process (right now
configuration is hard-coded to use Intan's naming conventions).

* (channel tool) Filter out channels that are artifacty (previous feature,
removed during refactoring).

* (processing) Normalize persistence spectrum power to make plotting range
insensitive to signal amplitude.

* (I/O) Provide a multi-threaded iteration function for users who have the
parallel computing toolbox.

* (Intan) Finish breaking out "traditional intan format" code.

* (Intan) Add one-file-per-type Intan reading code (as "Neuroscope" vendor?).

* (channel tool) GUI initialization fails if re-running after moving the
burst frequency sliders (via "clear; close all; nloop_channeltool").

* (Open Ephys) Add a reader for old-style one-file-per-channel format.

* (I/O) Reading Open Ephys with channel name templates that don't match
ends up reading all channels without filtering (OpenEphys tests).

* (I/O) Make Field Trip readData and readEvents call readHeader if they're
only passed one argument. I'm not sure this is needed, but the bids_tsv
example is set up this way.

* (Intan) Offer digital banks as words, in addition to as boolean signals.
This involves stitching together per-channel files, or (for monolithic)
splitting out word data into bits.

* (I/O) Add support for nlFT_readTableEvents(), to parse tabular data as
an event list. Right now we're only parsing it as waveform data.

* (sanity tool) Consider porting the Exp Utils sanity-checking tool over
as either sample code or a stand-alone application.

* (channel tool) Doublecheck that the Channel Tool still works.

* (documentation) Add documentation (to README or in a notes folder)
explaining how to use the channel iteration hooks and how the architecture
as a whole is supposed to work and why it was set up that way.


## Deferred to version 2:



## Abbreviated changelog:

* 04 Mar 2022 --
Added data series "sanity check" functions. Updated documentation.
Bug fix in palette generation function. Additional FT utility function.
* 24 Feb 2022 --
Added a Field Trip reader for in-memory tabular data. Moved
"interpolateSeries" from `exp-utils-cjt` to here.
* 27 Jan 2022 --
Finished event support; can interconvert between continuous and event-based
data as-needed. Added span-based reading support for reading desired sample
ranges; reading is now much faster for short spans.
* 21 Jan 2022 --
Partial support for Open Ephys TTL events. Reading as waveform data for
individual bits only, for the moment.
* 11 Jan 2021 --
Initial support for one-file-per-channel Intan and monolithic Open Ephys.
Not reading events or spike data yet.
* 15 Dec 2021 --
Moved libraries to a "libraries" folder and added a top-level script to add
sub-folders to Matlab's path.
Moved application code to "code-applications" and my test code to
"code-examples".
* 14 Dec 2021 --
Moved I/O routines into their own folder.
Moved channel iteration into I/O, from channel tool.
Refactored I/O to centralize vendor-independent code and to package
vendor-specific code.
Started porting Intan's code to the library, with permission. Metadata code
is ported, monolithic "Intan format" code is not.
* 13 Oct 2020 --
Milestone release.
* 09 Oct 2020 --
Fixed frequency axis scaling bug in calcSpectrumSkew.m.
