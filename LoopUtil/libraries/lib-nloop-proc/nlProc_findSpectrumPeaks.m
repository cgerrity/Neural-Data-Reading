%
% This takes the frequency spectrum of the specified signal, bins it in the
% log-frequency domain, and looks for narrow peaks against the background.
%
% "wavedata" is a vector containing waveform sample data.
% "samprate" is the sampling rate of the waveform data.
% "peakwidth" is the relative width of the fine-resolution frequency bins.
%   A value of 0.1 would mean a bin width of 2 Hz at a frequency of 20 Hz.
% "backgroundwidth" is the ratio between the upper and lower frequencies of
%   the span used to evaluate noise background around any given bin. A value
%   of 1.0 would mean evaluating noise over a one-octave span.
% "peakthresh" is the magnitude threshold for recognizing a peak in the
%   frequency spectrum. This is a multiple of the average local background.
%
% "peakfreqs" is a vector containing peak center frequencies in Hz.
% "peakheights" is a vector containing peak heights relative to the background.
% "peakwidths" is a vector containing relative peak widths (FWHM / frequency).
% "binmags" is a vector containing frequency spectrum bin magnitudes.
% "binfreqs" is a vector containing frequency spectrum bin center frequencies.
