%
% This identifies artifacts as excursions in the signal's amplitude or
% derivative, and replaces affected regions with NaN. Excursion thresholds
% are expressed in terms of the standard deviation of the signal or its
% derivative.
%
% "oldseries" is the series to process.
% "ampthresh" is the threshold for flagging amplitude excursion artifacts.
% "derivthresh" is the threshold for flagging derivative excursion artifacts.
% "ampthreshfall" is the turn-off threshold for amplitude artifacts.
% "derivthreshfall" is the turn-off threshold for derivative artifacts.
% "trimbefore" is the number of samples to squash ahead of the artifact.
% "trimafter" is the number of samples to squash after the artifact.
% "smoothsamps" is the size of the smoothing window to apply before taking
%   the derivative, or 0 for no smoothing.
% "dcsamps" is the size of the window for computing local DC average removal
%   ahead of computing signal statistics.
%
% Regions where the amplitude or derivative exceeds the threshold are flagged
% as artifacts. These regions are widened to encompass the region where the
% amplitude or derivative exceeds the "fall" threshold, and then padded by
% the specified number of samples. This is intended to correctly handle
% square-pulse artifacts and fast-step-slow-decay artifacts.


%
% Get the derivative (or a proxy for it).

% FIXME - Apply a moving window average repeatedly, to get something closer
% to a Gaussian.
