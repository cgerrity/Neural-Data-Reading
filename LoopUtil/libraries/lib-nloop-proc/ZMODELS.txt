An impedance model is a list of category definitions for clustering impedance
values. This is stored as a structure indexed by category label, with each
field containing a structure that defines that category's cluster.


A "box" cluster accepts all data points within a given range of magnitudes
and phase angles.
A "box" cluster definition structure has the following fields:

"type" is 'box'.
"magrange" [min max] is the range of accepted impedance magnitudes. This is
  typically the logarithm of the actual magnitude.
"phaserange" [min max] is the range of accepted impedance phase angles, in
  radians. A pair of angles defines two arcs - one larger than pi radians,
  and one smaller. The smaller arc is taken to be the accepted range.


An "orthogauss" cluster definition is a bivariate normal distribution with
principal axes parallel to the magnitude and phase axes. The category label
of a sample is the category whose probability density function is highest
for that sample, out to some maximum range (typically 3 sigma).
An "orthogauss" cluster definition structure has the following fields:

"type" is 'orthogauss'.
"magmean" is the magnitude distribution's mean.
"magdev" is the magnitude distribution's standard deviation.
"phasemean" is the phase distribution's circular mean (mean direction).
"phasedev" is the standard deviation of (phase - phase mean). This is
  assumed to be much smaller than 2pi (not needing circular statistics).


FIXME - There's a planned "gauss" model that has proper multivariate
Gaussian distributions with covariance matrices, but impedance data rarely
actually needs that, so it's deferred.
