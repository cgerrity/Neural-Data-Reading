% function memberstring = ...
%   nlIO_formatMemberList( candidates, format, memberflags )
%
% This formats a list of matching candidates in human-readable form, in a
% manner similar to page numbering (e.g. "5-6, 7, 12, 13-15"). Member
% entries that are contiguous in the candidate list are reported as ranges
% rather than as individuals.
%
% The candidate list is assumed to already be sorted in a sensible order.
%
% "candidates" is a vector or cell array containing member IDs or labels.
% "format" is a "sprintf" conversion format for turning a candidate ID or
%   label into appropriate human-readable output.
% "memberflags" is a logical vector of the same size as "candidates" that is
%   "true" for candidates that are to be reported and "false" otherwise.
%
% "memberstring" is a human-readable string summarizing the list of
%   candidates for which "memberflags" is true.
