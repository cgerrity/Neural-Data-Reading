%
% This searches a directory tree for files that match the specified name.
% This wraps "dir", so filenames can contain wildcards.
%
% "startdir" is the top-level folder to look in.
% "targetname" is the file name to match. This is passed to "dir", so it can
%   contain wildcards.
%
% "fnames_found" is a cell array containing the names of files found, without
%   paths.
% "paths_found" is a cell array containing the paths of files found, without
%   filenames.

dirlist = dir([ startdir filesep '**' filesep targetname ]);

for didx = 1:length(dirlist)
  thisentry = dirlist(didx);

% NOTE - If we had multiple matching files in a folder, we'll have duplicate
% entries in "paths_found". This is acceptable.


% Done.
