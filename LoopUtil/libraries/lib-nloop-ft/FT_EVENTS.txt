Field Trip events are constructed using channels that had type "eventbool"
or "eventwords" (i.e. channels that are stored as sparse rather than
continuous time series).

Field Trip's event record fields that we set are "sample" (event location in
samples), "value" (event value in the native channel type), and "type" (set
to the channel type: "eventbool" or "eventwords"). Other fields are set to
the empty value ([]).

Field Trip does not appear to support event filtering based on source (the
event's channel). To do this, use the "nlFT_selectChannels()" function before
calling "ft_read_events()". There should be exactly one channel selected;
results from selecting multiple channels are undefined.
