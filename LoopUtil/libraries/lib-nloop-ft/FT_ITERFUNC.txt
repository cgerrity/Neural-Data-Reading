An iteration processing function handle is called to perform signal
processing when iterating across trials and channels within a Field Trip
data structure. The intention is to simplify processing of Field Trip data
using non-FT functions.


An iteration processing function has the form:

[ waveresult otherresult ] = ...
  iterfunc( wavedata, timedata, samprate, trialidx, chanidx, chanlabel )

"wavedata" is a vector containing the waveform to be processed (from the
  Field Trip data's "trial" field).
"timedata" is a vector containing sample times (from the Field Trip data's
  "time" field).
"samprate" is the sampling rate (from the Field Trip data's "fsample" field).
"trialidx" is the trial number.
"chanidx" is the channel number.
"chanlabel" is the corresponding channel labe (from the Field Trip data's
  "label" field).

"waveresult" is a vector containing modified waveform data. This is
  typically used to build a modified version of the "trial" cell array.
"otherresult" is an arbitrary data type containing any other information
  that the user wishes to associate with this input data/trial/channel.


A typical iteration processing functiton definition would be as follows.
This example wraps a helper function that is passed additional arguments
set at the time the processing function is defined.

tuning_parameters = (stuff);
other_parameters = (stuff);
iterfunc = @( wavedata, timedata, samprate, trialidx, chanidx, chanlabel ) ...
  helper_do_iteration_processing( wavedata, timedata, samprate, ...
    trialidx, chanidx, chanlabel, tuning_parameters, other_parameters );
