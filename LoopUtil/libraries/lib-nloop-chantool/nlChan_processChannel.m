%
% This accepts a wideband waveform, performs filtering to split it into
% spike and LFP signals, and calculates various statistics for each of these
% signals.
%
% This is intended to be called by nlChan_iterateChannels() via a wrapper.
%
% "wavedata" is the waveform to process.
% "samprate" is the sampling rate.
% "refdata" is the reference waveform. This should already be truncated and
%   have artifacts removed, but should retain NaN values to avoid introducing
%   new artifacts. If refdata is [], no re-referencing is performed.
% "tuningart" is a structure containing tuning parameters for artifact removal.
% "tuningfilt" is a structure containing tuning parameters for filtering.
% "tuningspect" is a structure containing tuning parameters for persistence
%   spectrum generation.
% "tuningperc" is a structure containing tuning parameters for spike and
%   burst identification via percentile binning.
%
% "resultstats" is a structure containing the following fields:
%   "spikemedian", "spikeiqr", "spikeskew", and "spikepercentvals" are the
%     corresponding fields returned by nlProc_calcSkewPercentile() using the
%     high-pass-filtered spike signal.
%   "spikebincounts" and "spikebinedges" are the the corresponding fields
%     returned by histcounts() using a normalized version of the spike signal.
%   "spectfreqs", "spectmedian", "spectiqr", and "spectskew" are the
%     corresponding fields returned by nlChan_applySpectSkewCalc() using the
%     low-pass-filtered LFP signal.
%   "persistvals", "persistfreqs", and "persistpowers" are the corresponding
%     fields returned by pspectrum() using the LFP signal.
