Tuning parameter structures are used by several processing functions. These
structures are defined as follows.


An "artifact rejection tuning parameter" structure is used by
nlChan_applyArtifactReject(), and a default version is provided by
nlChan(getArtifactDefaults(). It has the following fields:

- "trimstart" is the number of seconds to remove at the start of the signal.
- "trimend" is the number of seconds to remove at the end of the signal.
- "ampthresh" is the high threshold for amplitude-based artifact detection.
- "amphalo" is the low threshold for amplitude-based artifact detection.
- "diffthresh" is the high threshold for derivative-based artifact detection.
- "diffhalo" is the low threshold for derivative-based artifact detection.
- "timehalosecs" is the additional time in seconds to squash around artifacts.
- "smoothsecs" is the time window size to use for smoothing the derivative.
- "dcsecs" is the time window size to use for DC removal.

See documentation for nlProc_removeArtifactsSigma() for further details of
the artifact rejection algorithm.



A "filter tuning parameter" structure is used by nlChan_applyFiltering(), and
a default version is provided by nlChan_getFilterDefaults(). It has the
following fields:

- "lfprate" is the sampling rate to use when generating the low-pass-filtered
  signal (LFP signal).
- "lfpcorner" is the sampling rate to use when splitting the signal into
  a low-pass-filtered signal (LFP signal) and high-pass-filtered signal
  (spike signal).
- "powerfreq" is a scalar or vector containing power line notch filter values
  to apply. This is typically the power line frequency and its harmonics.
- "dcfreq" is the corner frequency to use for the DC removal filter.

See documentation for nlProc_filterSignal() for further details of signal
filtering.



A "percentile tuning parameter" structure is used by nlChan_processChannel()
and by the "Channel Analysis Tool". It has the following fields:

- "burstrange" is a vector containing percentile values to use when looking
  for burst activity. This should be sorted in ascending order.
- "burstselectidx" is the index of the entry in "burstrange" to default to.
- "spikerange" is a vector containing percentile values to use when looking
  for spike activity. This should be sorted in ascending order.
- "spikeselectidx" is the index of the entry in "spikerange" to default to.

See documentation for nlProc_calcSkewPercentile() and documentation for
nlProc_calcSpectrumSkew() for further details of outlier identification for
activity detection.



A "spectrum tuning parameter" structure is used by nlChan_processChannel().
It has the following fields:

- "freqlow" is the minimum frequency to tabulate information for.
- "freqhigh" is the maximum frequency to tabulate information for.
- "freqsperdecade" specifies the spacing of frequency bins.
- "winsecs" is the time window size to use, in seconds.
- "winsteps" is the number of overlapping steps taken when advancing the
  time window. It advances "winsecs/winsteps" seconds per step.

See documentation for nlProc_calcSpectrumSkew() for further details of
outlier identification in time-frequency spectrograms.
