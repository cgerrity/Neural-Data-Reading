A "channel record" is a structure with the following fields:

"folder" is the folder ID of the channel.
"bank" is the bank ID of the channel.
"chan" is the channel number of the channel.
"result" is the processing result associated with this channel.

The intention is that a vector of channel records may be returned that
describes a ranked list of channels along with statistical analysis results
associated with each channel.
