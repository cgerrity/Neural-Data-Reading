%
% This processes a folder containing Intan-format data, iterating through
% a list of channels, loading each channel's waveform data in sequence and
% calling a processing function with that data. Processing output is
% aggregated and returned.
%
% This is implemented such that only a few channels are loaded at a time.
%
% "Native" channel time series are stored as sample numbers (not times).
% "Cooked" channel time series are in seconds. Cooked analog data is
% converted to the units specified in the bank metadata (volts or microvolts).
% Cooked TTL data is converted to boolean.
%
% "foldermetadata" is a folder-level metadata structure, per FOLDERMETA.txt.
% "folderchanlist" is a structure listing channels to process; it is a
%   folder-level channel list per CHANLIST.txt.
% "memchans" is the maximum number of channels that may be loaded into
%   memory at the same time.
% "procfunc" is a function handle used to transform channel waveform data
%   into "result" data, per PROCFUNC.txt.
% "procmeta" is the object to pass as the "metadata" argument of "procfunc".
% "procfid" is the label to pass as the "folderid" argument of "procfunc".
%
% "folderresults" is a folder-level channel list structure that has
%   bank-level channel lists augmented with a "resultlist" field, per
%   CHANLIST.txt. The "resultlist" field is a cell array containing
%   per-channel output from "procfunc".
