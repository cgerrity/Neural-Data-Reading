Intan-specific folder metadata format is as follows. This is intended as a
reference for maintaining code; nothing outside of this set of functions
should need to look at Intan-specific metadata.

The sole exception is knowing what to look for in the "devicetype" field.



In "folder metadata":

- "devicetype" is 'intan'.
- "nativemeta" is the output of nlIntan_readMetadata().
- Banks that may exist are as follows:
  - "AmpA".."AmpH" contain ephys channel signals.
  - "AuxA".."AuxH" contain on-chip aux analog input signals.
  - "DcA".."DcH" contain low-gain DC-coupled ephys channel signals.
  - "Ain" and "Aout" contain BNC analog inputs and outputs, respectiely.
  - "Din" and "Dout" contain TTL inputs and outputs, respectively.
  - "StimA".."StimH" contain stimulation drive currents.
  - "FlagsA".."FlagsH" contain encoded stimulation-related flags.
  - "VddA".."VddH" contain voltage supply signals.



In "signal bank metadata":

- "banktype" is:
  - 'boolean' for "Din" and "Dout", if they're stored per-channel.
  - 'integer' for "Din" and "Dout" otherwise.
  - 'flagvector' for "FlagsA".."FlagsH".
  - 'analog' for other banks.
- Ephys recording channels have "fpunits" of 'uV'; stimulation channels have
  "fpunits" of 'uA'. Other analog channels have "fpunits" of 'V'. Channels
  that aren't analog have "fpunits" of ''.
- "handle" is a structure with the following fields:

  - "format" is 'onefileperchan', 'neuroscope', or 'monolithic'.
  - "special" is '', 'stimflags' or 'stimcurrent'.

  For "monolithic":
    FIXME - Monolithic NYI.

  For "neuroscope":
    FIXME - Neuroscope NYI.

  For "onefileperchan":
  - "chanfilechans" is a vector containing channel indices in the same order
    as "chanfilenames".
  - "chanfilenames" is a vector containing channel data filenames in the
    same order as "chanfilechans".
  - "timefile" is the file to read sample indices from.



This is the end of the file.
