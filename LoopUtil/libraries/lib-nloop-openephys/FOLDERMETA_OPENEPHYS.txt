Open Ephys-specific folder metadata format is as follows. This is intended
as a reference for maintaining code; nothing outside of this set of functions
should need to look at Open Ephys-specific metadata.

The sole exception is knowing what to look for in the "devicetype" field.


FIXME - This may need to be updated if support for one file per channel
format and for spike data are added.



In "folder metadata":

- "devicetype" is 'openephys'.
- "firsttime" is the smallest timestamp value seen across all banks, in
  native format. The I/O functions subtract this from all per-bank timestamps.



In "signal bank metadata":

- "nativemeta" is the "header" field from the output of
    "load_open_ephys_binary()".
- "banktype" is:
  - 'analog' for continuous data.
  - 'eventwords' for the read-as-words alias of event data.
  - 'eventbool' for the read-as-bits alias of event data.
- "firsttime" is the smallest timestamp value seen in this bank, in native
  format.



This is the end of the file.
