This file documents Matlab structures used to represent configurations of
the ChannelMappingNode plugin in Open Ephys.

In Open Ephys v0.5.x, this also includes referencing information. In Open
Ephys v0.6.x, re-referencing is moved to its own plugin.



An Open Ephys v5 channel map is represented as a structure with the following
fields:

"oldchan" is a vector indexed by new channel number containing the old
  channel number that maps to each new location, or NaN if none does.

"oldref" is a vector indexed by new channel number containing the old
  channel number to be used as a reference for each new location, or NaN
  if unspecified.

"isenabled" is a vector of boolean values indexed by new channel number
  indicating which new channels are enabled.
