Something very important to keep in mind about Open Ephys's TTL events:

Individual TTL bit lines are always correct and consistent, but the word data
associated with these events is _not_ always consistent.


The problem happens because Open Ephys generates an event every time a bit
changes, so if multiple bits change during one sample, multiple events with
the same timestamp are generated. The "FullWords" vector is updated after
each event, one bit at a time - so events with the same timestamp will have
"FullWords" vectors with different content. The events are not necessarily
returned in the same order that they were processed in, so there's no easy
way to tell which "FullWords" value is the right one in a set of events
that have the same timestamp.


The right thing to do is to either build your own word data and ignore
the words provided by OpenEphys, or else to use additional knowledge about
the experiment scenario to disambiguate these cases.
