Data is saved in monolithic format ("traditional Intan"), one-file-per-type
format (NeuroScope-compatible), or one-file-per-channel format.



"Traditional Intan" format stores data as follows:

- Data is stored as a self-contained ".rhd" file (for the recording
  controller) or ".rhs" file (for the stimulate-and-record controller).

- A session may be saved as multiple independent files (with a new file
  started every N minutes).

- All ".rhd" and ".rhs" files begin with a header containing metadata.

- Blocks of data follow the header.

- For file formats other than "traditional Intan", an "info.rhd" or
  "info.rhs" file exists with a header and no blocks of data.

See Intan's file format documentation for stucture details for the header
and the data blocks.



"One-file-per-type" format (NeuroScope-compatible) stores signals in the
following files:

- All files are saved at the full sampling rate for ease of alignment, even
  if the underlying signals are sampled at lower rates (as with auxiliary
  and power supply signals).

- "time.dat" is a series of (signed int32) sample indices.

- "amplifier.dat" stores ephys channel signals (signed int16, 0.195 uV/LSB).

- "auxiliary.dat" (RHD only) stores on-chip aux analog input signals
  (unsigned uint16, 37.4 uV/LSB)

- "dcamplifier.dat" (RHS only) stores low-gain DC-coupled ephys channel
  signals (unsigned uint16, 19.23 mV/LSB, zero level 512).

- "analogin.dat" stores BNC analog input signals (unsigned uint16,
  0.3125 mV/LSB for RHS/RHD, 50.354 uV/LSB mode 0, 0.15259 mV/LSB mode 1,
  zero level 32768).

- "analogout.dat" (RHS only) stores BNC analog output signals (unsigned
  uint16, 0.3125 mV/LSB, zero level 32768).

- "digitalin.dat" stores TTL input signals as a packed unsigned 16-bit word.

- "digitalout.dat" stores TTL output signals as a packed unsigned 16-bit word.

- "stim.dat" (RHS only) stores stimulation current and flags as encoded
  unsigned 16-bit values. The least-significant 8 bits are the current
  magnitude (units per the header), the 9th bit is the sign, the 14th bit is
  amplifier settle, the 15th bit is the charge recovery, and the 16th bit is
  compliance limit. Note that bit numbering starts at 1, not 0.

- "supply.dat" (RHD only) stores on-chip supply voltage sensor signals
  (unsigned uint16, 74.8 uV/LSB)



"One-file-per-type" format (NeuroScope-compatible) stores signals in the
following files:

- File format is per "one-file-per-type", except with only one channel per
  file, unless otherwise indicated.

- All files are saved at the full sampling rate for ease of alignment, even
  if the underlying signals are sampled at lower rates (as with auxiliary
  and power supply signals).

- Note that as of 2021 the stim/record controller (RHS) only has four banks
  ("A".."D") and a maximum of 32 channels per bank ("000".."031").

- "time.dat" is a series of (signed int32) sample indices.

- "amp-X-NNN.dat" files store ephys channel signals for bank X ("A".."H")
  and channel NNN ("000".."127").

- "aux-X-AUXN.dat" files (RHD only) store on-chip aux analog input signals
  for bank X ("A".."H") and channel N ("1".."6"). Channels 1..3 are for the
  first connected chip and channels 4..6 are for the second connected chip
  on that bank.

- "dc-X-NNN.dat" files (RHS only) store low-gain DC-coupled ephys channel
  signals for bank X ("A".."H") and channel NNN ("000".."127").

- "board-ADC-NN.dat" files store BNC analog input signals for
  channel NN ("00".."07").
- "board-ANALOG-IN-NN.dat" is an alternate set of filenames for this.
- FIXME - Saved as 1..8, not 0..7!

- "board-ANALOG-OUT-N" files store BNC analog output signals for
  channel N ("0".."7").
- FIXME - Saved as 1..8, not 0..7!

- "board-DIN-NN.dat" files store TTL input signals for channel NN
  ("00".."15"). Samples are still unsigned uint16 values but only have
  values of 0 or 1.
- "board-DIGITAL-IN-NN.dat" is an alternate set of filenames for this.
- FIXME - Saved as 1..16, not 0..15!

- "board-DOUT-NN.dat" files store TTL output signals for channel NN
  ("00".."15"). Samples are still unsigned uint16 values but only have
  values of 0 or 1.
- "board-DIGITAL-OUT-NN.dat" is an alternate set of filenames for this.
- FIXME - Saved as 1..16, not 0..15!

- "stim-X-NNN.dat" files store encoded stimulation current and flags for
  bank X ("A".."H") and channel NNN ("000".."127").

- "vdd-X-VDDN.dat" files (RHD only) store on-chip supply voltage sensor
  signals for bank X ("A".."H"). "VDD1" is for the first connected chip and
  "VDD2" is for the second connected chip on that bank.



This is the end of the file.
